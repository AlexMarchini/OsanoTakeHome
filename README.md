# Osano take-home project

I chose to use Amazon.com for this assignment.
Here's the high level [test plan](https://airtable.com/shriND27rkkhhF9Bi)

## Implementation notes

* I focused on the main Amazon site and the most critical functions.
* I did not attempt to automate test cases to steps which required logging in. I ran into issues logging into the live site with automation.

## Usage

Run cypress tests headless
```bash
npm run run-cypress
```

Run cypress
```bash
npm run cypress
```
